# RAG Experiment

A personal experiment to build a RAG system that can answer questions from information sourced from a PDF document, in this case a PDF manual for my Garmin watch.

## Improvements

As an initial PoC it worked well enough, but it definitely needs some improvements:

- Grouping the text from the PDF into chapters would probably greatly improve the effectiveness of the responses.
- Build a user interface.
